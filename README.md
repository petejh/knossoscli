# Knossos CLI
A command line companion to the [`knossos`][gem] Ruby gem for generating mazes.

## Installation
Install globally with:
```bash
~$ gem install knossoscli
```

## Usage
The Knossos CLI actually comprises a suite of commands similar to familiar tools
like `git` and `bundler`. You can see a summary of the available sub-commands by
invoking:
```bash
~$ knossos help
```
More detailed documentation for each sub-command is available with, for example:
```bash
~$ knossos help carve
```

Generate a maze in your terminal:
```bash
~$ knossos carve
```
